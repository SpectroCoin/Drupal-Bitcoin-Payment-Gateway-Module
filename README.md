## Make it work on localhost

We gently suggest trying out the plugin in a server environment, as it will not be capable of receiving callbacks from SpectroCoin if it will be hosted on localhost. To successfully create and order on localhost for testing purposes, <b>change these 3 lines in <em>SCMechantClient.php createOrder() function</em></b>:

`'callbackUrl' => $request->getCallbackUrl()`, <br>
`'successUrl' => $request->getSuccessUrl()`, <br>
`'failureUrl' => $request->getFailureUrl()`

<b>To</b>

`'callbackUrl' => 'http://localhost.com'`, <br>
`'successUrl' => 'http://localhost.com'`, <br>
`'failureUrl' => 'http://localhost.com'`

Adjust it appropriately if your local environment URL differs.
Don't forget to change it back when migrating website to public.
