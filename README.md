## Test order creation on localhost

We gently suggest trying out the plugin in a server environment, as it will not be capable of receiving callbacks from SpectroCoin if it will be hosted on localhost. To successfully create an order on localhost for testing purposes, __change these 3 lines in <em>CreateOrderRequest.php</em>__:

```
$this->callbackUrl = isset($data['callbackUrl']) ? Utils::sanitizeUrl($data['callbackUrl']) : null;,
$this->successUrl = isset($data['successUrl']) ? Utils::sanitizeUrl($data['successUrl']) : null;,
$this->failureUrl = isset($data['failureUrl']) ? Utils::sanitizeUrl($data['failureUrl']) : null;
```
__To__

```
$this->callbackUrl = "https://localhost.com/";,
$this->successUrl = "https://localhost.com/";,
$this->failureUrl = "https://localhost.com/";
```
Don't forget to change it back when migrating website to public.

## Testing Callbacks

Order callbacks in the SpectroCoin plugin allow your WordPress site to automatically process order status changes sent from SpectroCoin. These callbacks notify your server when an orderâ€™s status transitions to PAID, EXPIRED, or FAILED. Understanding and testing this functionality ensures your store handles payments accurately and updates order statuses accordingly.
 
1. Go to your SpectroCoin project settings and enable **Test Mode**.
2. Simulate a payment status:
   - **PAID**: Sends a callback to mark the order as **Completed** in WordPress.
   - **EXPIRED**: Sends a callback to mark the order as **Failed** in WordPress.
3. Ensure your `callbackUrl` is publicly accessible (local servers like `localhost` will not work).
4. Check the **Order History** in SpectroCoin for callback details. If a callback fails, use the **Retry** button to resend it.
5. Verify that:
   - The **order status** in WordPress has been updated accordingly.
   - The **callback status** in the SpectroCoin dashboard is `200 OK`.

## Changelog
